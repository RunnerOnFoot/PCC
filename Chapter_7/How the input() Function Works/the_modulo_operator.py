# A useful tool for working with numerical information is the modulo operator (%),
# which divides one number by another number and returns the remainder:
print(4 % 3)
print(5 % 3)
print(6 % 3)
print(7 % 3)

# The modulo operator doesnâ€™t tell you how many times one number fits into another;
# it only tells you what the remainder is.
