PEP 8 recommends that you use four spaces per indentation level. 
Using four spaces improves readability while leaving room for multiple levels of indentation on each line.

In a word processing document, people often use tabs rather than spaces to indent. 
This works well for word processing documents, but the Python interpreter gets confused when tabs are mixed with spaces. 
Every text editor provides a setting that lets you use the TAB key but then converts each tab to a set number of spaces. 
You should definitely use your TAB key, but also make sure your editor is set to insert spaces rather than tabs into your document.

Mixing tabs and spaces in your file can cause problems that are very difficult to diagnose. 
If you think you have a mix of tabs and spaces, you can convert all tabs in a file to spaces in most editors.
