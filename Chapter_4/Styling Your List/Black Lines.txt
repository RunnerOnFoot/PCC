To group parts of your program visually, use blank lines. 
You should use blank lines to organize your files, but don’t do so excessively.
By following the examples provided in this book, you should strike the right balance. 
For example, if you have five lines of code that build a list and then another three lines that do something with that list, it’s appropriate to place a blank line between the two sections. However, you should not place three or four blank lines between the two sections.

Blank lines won’t affect how your code runs, but they will affect the readability of your code. 
The Python interpreter uses horizontal indentation to interpret the meaning of your code, but it disregards vertical spacing.
