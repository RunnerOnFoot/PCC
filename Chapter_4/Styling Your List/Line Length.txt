Many Python programmers recommend that each line should be less than 80 characters. 
Historically, this guideline developed because most computers could fit only 79 characters on a single line in a terminal window. 
Currently, people can fit much longer lines on their screens, but other reasons exist to adhere to the 79-character standard line length.

Professional programmers often have several files open on the same screen, and using the standard line length allows them to see entire lines in two or three files that are open side by side onscreen. 
PEP 8 also recommends that you limit all of your comments to 72 characters per line, because some of the tools that generate automatic documentation for larger projects add formatting characters at the beginning of each commented line.

The PEP 8 guidelines for line length are not set in stone, and some teams prefer a 99-character limit. 
Don’t worry too much about line length in your code as you’re learning, but be aware that people who are working collaboratively almost always follow the PEP 8 guidelines. 
Most editors allow you to set up a visual cue, usually a vertical line on your screen, that shows you where these limits are.
