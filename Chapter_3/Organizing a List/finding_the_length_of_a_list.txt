You can quickly find the length of a list by using the len() function.

You’ll find len() useful when you need to identify the number of aliens that still need to be shot down in a game,
determine the amount of data you have to manage in a visualization,
or figure out the number of registered users on a website, among other tasks.

NOTE:
    Python counts the items in a list starting with one,
    so you shouldn’t run into any off-by-one errors when determining the length of a list.
