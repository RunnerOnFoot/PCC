Often, you’ll want to remove an item or a set of items from a list.
For example, when a player shoots down an alien from the sky, you’ll most likely want to remove it from the list of active aliens.
Or when a user decides to cancel their account on a web application you created, you’ll want to remove that user from the list of active users.
You can remove an item according to its position in the list or according to its value.
