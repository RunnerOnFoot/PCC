Sometimes youâ€™ll want to use the value of an item after you remove it from a list.
For example, you might want to get the x and y position of an alien that was just shot down,
so you can draw an explosion at that position.
In a web application,
you might want to remove a user from a list of active members and then add that user to a list of inactive members.

The pop() method removes the last item in a list, but it lets you work with that item after removing it.
The term pop comes from thinking of a list as a stack of items and popping one item off the top of the stack.
In this analogy, the top of a stack corresponds to the end of a list.
